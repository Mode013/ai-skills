# Deepening

How to deepen a cluster of shallow modules safely, given its dependencies. Assumes the vocabulary in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) — **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**.

## Dependency categories

When assessing a candidate for deepening, classify its dependencies. The category determines how the deepened module is tested across its seam.

### 1. In-process

Pure computation, in-memory state, no I/O. Consider merging only when shared responsibility or coupling justifies it; absence of I/O alone is not a reason. Test the resulting behavior through the appropriate interface.

### 2. Local-substitutable

Dependencies that have local test stand-ins (PGLite for Postgres, in-memory filesystem). Deepenable if the stand-in exists. The deepened module is tested with the stand-in running in the test suite. The seam is internal; no port at the module's external interface.

### 3. Remote but owned (Ports & Adapters)

Your own services across a network boundary (microservices, internal APIs). Define a **port** (interface) at the seam. The deep module owns the logic; the transport is injected as an **adapter**. Tests use an in-memory adapter. Production uses an HTTP/gRPC/queue adapter.

Recommendation shape: *"Define a port at the seam, implement an HTTP adapter for production and an in-memory adapter for testing, so the logic sits in one deep module even though it's deployed across a network."*

### 4. True external (Mock)

Third-party services (Stripe, Twilio, etc.) you don't control. The deepened module takes the external dependency as an injected port; tests provide a mock adapter.

## Seam discipline

- **Justify each port.** Production and test adapters are useful evidence of variation; a stable contract, ownership boundary, or isolation requirement can also justify a single-adapter port. Avoid indirection with no concrete benefit.
- **Internal seams vs external seams.** A deep module can have internal seams (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the external seam at its interface. Don't expose internal seams through the interface just because tests use them.

## Testing strategy: preserve behavioral coverage

- Before replacing old tests, map their meaningful scenarios and assertions to the new interface tests. Keep unique regression and boundary cases. Remove a test only after demonstrating that its checks are preserved elsewhere or its requirement no longer applies; explain the evidence first. A higher-level passing test alone is not enough.
- For consequential behavior, use a relevant negative control or mutation to confirm that the replacement test detects the original fault.
- Write new tests at the deepened module's interface. The **interface is the test surface**.
- Tests assert on observable outcomes through the interface, not internal state.
- Tests should survive internal refactors — they describe behaviour, not implementation. If a test has to change when the implementation changes, it's testing past the interface.
